		<div>
			<p>My name is Joe Deger and I am pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science at the University of Cincinnati. I am in my 3rd year and expect to graduate in May of 2021. Programming is one of my favorite skills, and I enjoy utilizing it in my day-to-day life. I esecially like web-development. I very actively watch and paper-trade in the stock market and I keep this website updated with all my trades, including pictures of the stock at the time of the trade to reference and reflect on.</p>
			<p>Technology has always been an interest of mine, and in my free time I like to experiment with an arduino set creating small gadgets. This became a hobby of mine after I built my own computer.</p>
			<p>I can be reached at degerje@mail.uc.edu</p>

			<h2>PCMS: Quality Analyst Co-op</h2>
			<p>August 2018 - December 2018</p>
			<p>As a Quality Analyst as PCMS I had the responsibility of testing the software before we delivered to the customer. My testing would vary between testing new functionality and defect fixes. When I was testing new functionality I would read through the BRD (Business Requirements Document) and develope test cases to check once it was added. For defect testing I would check to see if the original defect was fixed, and then test to make sure the fix didn't break another part of the program.</p>
			<p>Starting as a QA I did not know what Requirement-Based Testing was yet, but I learned pretty quickly. We were trained to test all of the obvious scenarios and then told to try and break the software if we could. Breaking the software before it got delivered to the customer is always preferred as it gives the team an opportunity to go in an correct mistakes before the cutomer sees. More often than not there is some far-fetched way to break the code, it's just a matter of figuring out how. Learning RBT I believe will prepare me for developement work because I will already be thinking of ways the program could break and take that into consideration when writing the code.</p>
			<p>After testing I would report back my results, usually just as a comment on the Jira ticket, but if I were to run into a fatal error I would bring it up right away and that would usually become the highest priority defect. Either way, communication skills are vital when testing. You need to be able to tell someone exactly what you mean and mean exactly what you say. My communication skills improved once I understood the applications better and I was able to be more efficient in testing.</p>
			<p>In addition to RBT and communication skills, I also got to learn about other aspects of the developement process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Learned Requirement-Based Testing</li>
				<li>Learned how to navigate an extensive databse to access relevent information</li>
				<li>Learned the Agile Software Developement process</li>
				<li>Learned how to read and modify files in the program</li>
				<li>Worked on a scrum team and contributed to daily scrum meetings</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>QA Training</h2>
			<p>Before completing my first co-op rotation with PCMS I had the responsibility of training the new QA for our team. This included walking her through our testing procedures and introducing all of the relevenat information required for requirement based testing. Some information such as command line functions or database queries I felt should be documented to save training time so I created a reference sheet in the team's Jira. This saved me time walking through a procedure multiple times and allowed me to keep up with my tasks a well.</p>
			<h2>Bartending</h2>
			<p>Being a bartender at Arthur's is something that is earned. Training starts at the most basic positions of lead, SA, and expo. After mastering those, employees are trained as servers. Once a server turns 21 and has shown they are responsible, they are trained as a bartender. Because of all the training bartenders go through, other employees can turn to them for any question they may have. Guests can also rely on the bartender to answer any questions conserning the food or alcohol.</p>

				<h2>Computer</h2>
				<p>Over the summer of 2018 I began looking into building my own computer because I wanted a good PC for gaming and programming but didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for one. I also wanted the experience of building it myself and the ability to upgrade individual parts when I see fit. I did my reasearch and came up with a list of compatible parts that would satisfy my needs.</p>
				<p>I decided to get a cheaper GPU in exchange for a better CPU since the games I play don't require a top-of-the-line GPU and I would be doing more productive things that require more processing power. You may notice The Flash inside the computer. This is not for asthetics; this is to make the computer run faster.</p>
				<ul>Hardware:
					<li>MSI Z270 Gaming Plus Motherboard</li>
					<li>EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 GPU</li>
					<li>Intel i7-7700K CPU</li>
					<li>Cooler Master CPU Cooler (heat sink + fan)</li>
					<li>2x Corsair Vengeance DDR4 DRAM 8GB</li>
					<li>Samsung 850 EVO 250GB SSD</li>
					<li>Seagate 2TB BarraCuda HDD</li>
					<li>EVGA SuperNOVA 650W Power Supply</li>
					<li>NZXT S340 MiD Tower Computer Case</li>

				<h2>Word Search Mania</h2>
				<p>Word Search Mania was created using on Python 3 and the PyQt5 framework. The application will randomly pull words out from a 370K word dictionary file to populate the puzzle. The user also has the option to create a custom word bank from the customization menu.</p>
				<p>In addition to making your own word bank, the user can select the size of word search they want as well. This can vary the difficulty of the games. Highscores are recorded and stored so users can try to beat thier previous scores and comapre with other.</p>
				<p>This project utilized the teams object-oriented programming skills as well as external libraries. The PyQT5 library made it very easy to create and modify the GUI. I learned a lot about working as a team on a single application and how important communication is when everyone is working on a seperate part.</p>
